# Pretty private system

Another work in progress project, the goals are:
* having fun :-)
* being able to access sensitive data like contacts via a web UI
* the sensitive data must be stored in a secured way. Currently it uses a SQLCipher file stored on the server side, in the future I would like to implement a front-end that would take care of deciphering the data via opengpg.js
